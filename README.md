#Kaggle Titantic Challenge 


This is my submission for the Kaggle Titantic Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to predict if each passenger survived the sinking or not. I broke my code into two components: one for the data treatment/transformation steps and one for the actual modelling. 


I will be updating it as I improve my model.
